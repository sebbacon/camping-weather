# Long term camping weather predictions

We just had a long weekend of torrential rain.

You have to book nice campsites well in advance of meaningful weather
forecasts.

Is it possible to pick the best locations / weekends for completely
avoiding rain, months in advance?

Let's find out.

See the jupyter notebook `experiments.ipynb` for the first steps of
the investigation.

Data generated by running `get_data.py`.
